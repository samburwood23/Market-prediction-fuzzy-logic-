Fuzzy Logic Analytics for Trading & Marketing
A comprehensive Python framework for predictive analytics using fuzzy logic systems, designed to maximize shareholder value through intelligent trading decisions and marketing optimization.

Overview
This project implements advanced fuzzy logic inference systems for handling uncertainty in financial and marketing data. By combining linguistic variables, membership functions, and rule-based reasoning, the system provides actionable insights for:

Trading Analytics: Price prediction, trend analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization
Marketing Analytics: Customer segmentation, campaign effectiveness, ROI prediction, and resource allocation
Shareholder Value: Integration of both domains to maximize long-term shareholder returns
Features
Fuzzy Logic Engine: Complete implementation of Mamdani and Sugeno inference systems
Trading Indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands integrated with fuzzy reasoning
Marketing Metrics: CLV, CAC, churn prediction with fuzzy classification
Shareholder Value Framework: Multi-objective optimization combining trading and marketing insights
Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards for membership functions and rule outputs
Backtesting: Historical simulation for strategy validation
